not sure if this is everything including microRNAs or what

I clicked Download: TEXT link in the upper right.  Got a file.

there seem to be >650 rows in this file:

$ wc -l ~/Downloads/ena.text 
     668 /Users/langmead/Downloads/ena.text

Even though the consortium sequenced 460-some

AHA!!

$ cat ~/Downloads/ena.text  | awk -v 'FS=\t' '{print $3}' | sort -u | wc -l
     465

Hmm.. but only 464 without column labels:
$ cat ~/Downloads/ena.text  | awk -v 'FS=\t' '{print $3}' | grep -v sample | sort -u | wc -l
     464

Here's how to get the FTP URLs
head ~/Downloads/ena.text  | awk -v 'FS=\t' '{print $9}'

Seems like a typical file is about 3 GB:

$ curl -sI ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR188/ERR188029/ERR188029_1.fastq.gz | grep Content-Length
Content-Length: 2866825986
$ curl -sI ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR188/ERR188029/ERR188029_2.fastq.gz | grep Content-Length
Content-Length: 2885694636

so extrapolate to 3 GB * 2 (pairs) * 465 (samples) and you get about 3 TB.
