This directory contains scripts for obtaining the coverage information from the 
bigWig files, identifying the expressed regions (ERs) for each chromosome, and
merging the results from all the chromosomes. Note that we identified the ERs
per chromosome because this is a larger data set than some we had previously
analyzed.

These scripts are similar to those from [derSoftware](http://leekgroup.github.io/derSoftware/).
