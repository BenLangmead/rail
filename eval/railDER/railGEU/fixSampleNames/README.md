This directory has the scripts for matching the sample names from the GEUVADIS
`ballgown` object and the Rail-RNA manifest files. The same script creates the
`GRanges` object with the ERs (`regions.Rdata`) and the coverage matrix
(`coverageMatrix.Rdata`). The latter is a large file, so it's not version
controlled. You can find it via Figshare at [ADD LINK](http://figshare.com).
