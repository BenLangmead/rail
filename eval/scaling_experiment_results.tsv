# Wall clock running time including provisioning+bootstrap is the "Elapsed time" from the EMR console.
# Wall clock running time excluding provisioning+bootstrap is the 
# Cost per sample excluding DynamoDB charges is computed by rounding up 3rd column to the nearest # hours and charging ($0.11/instance/hr (that is, the spot price) + $0.105/instance/hr).
# Note that the first column is off by 1 from the number of instances reserved; there's always one additional master instance.
