# Results of scaling experiments executed with run_scaling_experiments.sh
# Wall clock running time including provisioning+bootstrap is the "Elapsed time" from the EMR console.
# Wall clock running time excluding provisioning+bootstrap is the result of summing all step times
# Cost per sample including provisioning and bootstrap is estimated by rounding up 3rd column to the nearest # hours and charging ($0.11/instance/hr (spot price upper bound) + $0.105/instance/hr (EMR surcharge)).
# Cost per sample excluding provisioning and bootstrap is estimated by rounding up 4th column to the nearest # hours and charging ($0.11/instance/hr (spot price upper bound) + $0.105/instance/hr (EMR surcharge)).
# Note that the first column is off by 1 from the number of instances reserved; there's always one additional master instance.
