Contains files for evaluating the accuracy of different aligners.

Before running, edit the 'chromosomes' and 'chr_lengths' arrays at the 
beginning of either read_alignments.py (for coverage) or read_junctions.py 
(for junctions) to match the reference genome used.

To compare the coverage vectors from an aligner, run
  ./comp_coverage.py actual predicted
where 'actual' and 'predicted' are either SAM or BED alignment files.

To compare junctions, run
  ./comp_junctions.py actual predicted
where 'actual' and 'predicted' are either SAM or BED alignment files 
or a GTF file containing transcript and exon information.
