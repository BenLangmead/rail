Here are some relevant Hadoop/EMR issues that we should keep track of:

 - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9577
   I saw instances where files in the 'exon' subdir of the align-step output
   were clearly truncated very early on, often in the middle of a record.  The
   stderr logs seemed to indicate my task was running to completion just fine,
   but in all cases there was also a cancelled speculative task attempt.  I 
   guessed that the truncated outputs were because of the cancelled attempt
   and I think I fixed it by disabling speculative execution for both mappers
   and reducers.  However, it could be that once this JIRA is addressed, we can
   re-enable it.  Note that this is only a problem when the align step is
   writing its output directly to S3.
