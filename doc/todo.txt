Design TODOs:
- ebayes.py, hmm_params.py are scalability bottlenecks
- walk_fit.py is slow because of repeated linear model fit

Implementation TODOs:
- Output per-sample bed track in walk_prenorm.py
  + Convert to bigBed and push to permanent filesystem (perhaps S3, HDFS)
- In merge.py detect when reads are spanning introns and emit some junction information
  + Lots-of-info option: For each read, a list of introns spanned
  + Tiny-info option: For each intron, a count of how many reads span it
  + Intermediate option: Intron cooccurrences in a per-gene matrix

Validation TODOs:
- Reasonable results from a simulation?
