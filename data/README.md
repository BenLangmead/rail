Datasets
--------

See studies.tsv for a description of all the studies collected here and their
respective sizes.  We're also hoping to include many other studies that
require us to apply for access, including:

* [TCGA]
* [Depression genes and networks]
* [METABRIC]
* [GTEx]

[TCGA]: https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/
[Depression genes and networks]: https://www.nimhgenetics.org/access_data_biomaterial.php
[METABRIC]: http://molonc.bccrc.ca/aparicio-lab/research/metabric/
[GTEx]: http://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/

As of 10/11/2013 all the manifest files in these subdirectories were created
by hand by me (Ben) using the best information I could find about the files
generated by these projects.  This is painstaking and error-prone and I hope,
but can't gaurantee that I haven't left any samples/files behind.
