So far we have compiled manifest files for the following publicly-available
studies:

* [ENCODE] ([papers][ENCODE papers])
* [GEUVADIS] ([papers][GEUVADIS papers])
* [Roadmap Epigenomics] ([papers][[Roadmap Epigenomics papers]])
* [BodyMap 2.0]
* [Pickrell et al] ([paper][Pickrell et al paper])
* [Cuffdiff 2] ([paper][Cuffdiff 2 paper])

See `studies.tsv` for a more detailed description of the studies collected so
far and their respective sizes.  We're also hoping to include many other
studies that require us to apply for access, including:

* [TCGA]
* [Depression genes and networks]
* [METABRIC]
* [GTEx]

[TCGA]: https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/

[METABRIC]: http://molonc.bccrc.ca/aparicio-lab/research/metabric/
[GTEx]: http://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/

As of 10/11/2013 all the manifest files in these subdirectories were created
by hand by me (Ben) using the best information I could find about the files
generated by these projects.  This is painstaking and error-prone and I hope,
but can't gaurantee that I haven't left any samples/files behind.
