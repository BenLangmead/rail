Sometimes it's necessary to write a little Java class that we can plug
into Hadoop, e.g. to enable new input and output formats or to
customize the shuffle/sort step.

Right now we just have one class here that extends
MultipleTextOutputFormat and makes it so that the output from a compute
step gets divvied up into subdirectories with names equal to the first
field of output.
